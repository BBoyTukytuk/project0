# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is Project 0 and it is my first time making a website.

My wife is in the jewelry business, and I wanted to create a website for her.

This website is modelled around companies such as Tiffany and 4C, however, I wanted to make it a lot simpler as I found jewelry websites to be very cluttered.

The index page

The first page and is styled by both bootstrap and sass(which creates a css). You will notice there is a pop up button at the top that takes you to the schedule page or you can click x to ignore.
There are also two buttons that take you to a Japanese translated page or a mobile page. The icons came from fontawesome.com.
You will see a logo called "One and Ever" which is the name of the jewelry brand and this is also a link to refresh the page.
There are four titles in a grid spacing them evenly across the page that take you to a gallery.
There is a carousel that continuously rotates two pictures (you also have arrows to manually control it) Most of the code for this I found on the internet. I added text to each picture to act as a link to the gallery.
The bottom is a container for three pictures. These will also take you to the gallery.

The Japanese index Page

This is almost identical to the index page, however the text is in Japanese and the links will take you to different pages.
This is so that the user can look at the gallery or mobile page and return to the Japanese index easily.
This is because I found some sites lacking an easy to access to a Japanese option.

The Jewelry Page (gallery)

As I do not have any pictures of actual jewelry, to save time I have just copy and pasted the same jewelry.
What you will find is at the top, the one and ever logo to take you back to the index, followed by rows.
Each picture you click on enlarges to fill up the page and I have a X button on the top right to close the enlarged image.
I made sure that there are three gallery pages that take you back to either the English, Japanese page or mobile.

The Mobile Page

This is a very simple page again with the "One and Ever" logo at the top to refresh the page, a button to take you to the desktop for English or Japanese followed by 4 sections of collapsible buttons.
The point here was to make sure that on a users could just scroll to the information they need.
When you open up each section you will find the pictures of the jewelry links to the gallery.

The Schedule page

This is a table that shows the opening hours of the stores (that I wish we had). This is a simple page in which the only way to go out is to press the "One and Ever" logo at the top.
Much like the mobile page, if you access it from any of the other pages, it will take you back to the according English, Japanese or mobile page.
